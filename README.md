## Introduction

In this project, we build a CNN model that can classify images from various categories. The model is trained on a dataset of images stored in a directory structure, with separate folders for each class. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with visualizations to analyze performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-cnn.git
cd image-classification-cnn
```

## Usage

1. Place your images in the appropriate directories (`Training`, `Validation`, and `Testing`), ensuring each class has its own folder.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The script will train the model on the training data, validate it on the validation data, and evaluate it on the test data.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The project includes a function to load images from directories, preprocess them (resize, normalize), and create corresponding labels. Images are loaded in batches using the `ImageDataGenerator` class, which can also perform data augmentation.

```python
def load_images_from_directory(directory, target_size=(224, 224)):
    images = []
    labels = []
    class_names = os.listdir(directory)
    for label, class_name in enumerate(class_names):
        class_path = os.path.join(directory, class_name)
        if os.path.isdir(class_path):
            for img_file in os.listdir(class_path):
                img_path = os.path.join(class_path, img_file)
                
                # Only process files with valid image extensions
                if img_file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.bmp', '.gif', '.heic')):
                    try:
                        img = load_img(img_path, target_size=target_size)
                        img_array = img_to_array(img)
                        images.append(img_array)
                        labels.append(label)
                    except UnidentifiedImageError:
                        print(f"Warning: Skipping invalid image {img_file}")
                else:
                    print(f"Skipping non-image file: {img_file}")
    
    return np.array(images), np.array(labels), class_names
```

## Model Training and Evaluation

The CNN model is defined and compiled in the main script. The training process includes:

- Training the model on the training dataset.
- Validating the model on the validation dataset.
- Evaluating performance on the test dataset.

The training and evaluation results are printed out, including loss and accuracy metrics.

```python
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), epochs=25, batch_size=10)
```

## Visualizing Results

After training, the following visualizations are generated:

- **Training and Validation Accuracy Plot**: Visualizes the training and validation accuracy over epochs.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays the confusion matrix for the test predictions to evaluate the classification performance.
- **Classification Report**: Outputs precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

```python
# Example code to plot accuracy
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
